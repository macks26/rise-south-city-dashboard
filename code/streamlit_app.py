    ### üß™ Composite Risk Score

    This map displays a **composite air and health risk score** for each census tract in South San Francisco and San Bruno.  
    **Darker shading** indicates **higher overall risk** in a given tract.  

    The score combines two parts:  
    - An **air quality risk score**, calculated from daily PM2.5 concentrations reported by Clarity and PurpleAir monitors. These values are converted into **Air Quality Index (AQI)** scores using EPA standards.  
    - A **health risk score**, which integrates **health equity data** along with **general and respiratory health metrics** to identify communities more vulnerable to air pollution.  

    The final score is a **weighted combination** of the two, highlighting areas where both pollution levels and health vulnerabilities are high.
    """)

    st.info("""
    ### üì° Monitor Predictability Index

    The map also shows the locations of **air quality monitors**, each marked with a **predictability index**.  
    This index reflects how **reliably a monitor's readings can be predicted** using historical data and nearby monitors.  

    It is calculated using a combination of:  
    - **Self-predictability** ‚Äî how well a monitor's past data can forecast its future readings.  
    - **Cross-predictability** ‚Äî how well nearby monitors can be used to predict a monitor's readings.  

    A **higher predictability index** suggests more stable or consistent readings, while **lower scores** may indicate irregular behavior or localized factors affecting air quality.

    st.info('PM2.5 and Airport Traffic Timeline: This visualization displays monthly passenger traffic at San Francisco International Airport (bottom, January 2018 to December 2024). The sharp drop in air travel during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) aligned with a noticeable decline in PM2.5 levels, suggesting that reduced airport operations may have improved local air quality. As air traffic rebounded in 2021 and beyond, PM2.5 concentrations also rose, pointing to a potential connection between flight activity and pollution levels. However, a late-2020 spike in PM2.5 was likely driven by wildfires, underscoring that airport emissions are just one piece of a larger puzzle. This natural experiment ‚Äî where travel volume changed drastically while other factors held steady ‚Äî offers a rare opportunity to isolate the airport‚Äôs contribution to regional air pollution. For communities near SFO, who already face multiple environmental and socioeconomic stressors, understanding this relationship is vital. These insights can inform targeted air quality interventions, regulatory strategies, and long-term planning to reduce the cumulative burden of pollution.')

The 'predictability index' here is simply the maximum correlation that a sensor had with any others, intended to illustrate possible sensor redundancies. In areas where sensors are highly redundant ‚Äî that is, another sensor's data can be used to accurately predict hourly readings ‚Äî there may be less of a need for more nearby sensors. This is overlaid on the percentage of uninsured residents in each tract to highlight areas where people may be most vulnerable to the health effects of air pollution. Those who are uninsured cannot easily access the treatments that would help them recover from, or maintain resilience to, poor air quality. Overall, the purpose of this figure is to show where additional air sensors are most needed. If an area has low health insurance coverage and low sensor redundancy, it might benefit from the placement of new sensors so that community members can take steps to protect their health.")
