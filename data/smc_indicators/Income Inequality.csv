"Income Inequality","This indicator shows the Gini Index of Income Inequality value. The Gini coefficient is commonly used as a measure of income inequality. The range of the coefficient is between 0 and 1, whereby 0 denotes complete equality in a population (every person receives the same income) and 1 denotes complete inequality (one person has all the wealth in the region).","Census Tract",06081600100,0.560,,0.472,0.649,,,,,No,2019-2023,"American Community Survey 5-Year","The U.S. Census Bureau calculates 90% confidence intervals for American Community Survey estimates.

"Income Inequality","This indicator shows the Gini Index of Income Inequality value. The Gini coefficient is commonly used as a measure of income inequality. The range of the coefficient is between 0 and 1, whereby 0 denotes complete equality in a population (every person receives the same income) and 1 denotes complete inequality (one person has all the wealth in the region).","Census Tract",06081614000,0.374,,0.326,0.422,,,,,No,2016-2020,"American Community Survey 5-Year","The U.S. Census Bureau calculates 90% confidence intervals for American Community Survey estimates. Use caution when interpreting values with wide confidence intervals. Confidence intervals that are farther away from estimates in either direction indicate uncertainty due to small survey sample sizes.
